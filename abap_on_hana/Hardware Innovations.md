## Hardware Innovations 
### 1. In Memory Database
* **Multicore Architecture** -
  Cores helps in handling tasks parallely by breaking tasks into sub tasks and parts and asssigning to each core.
* **Address Space** -
  1 bit stores 2 numbers. 2 bit stores 4 numbers.
  Bits stores 2^n. 32 bit can handle upto 4 GB of memory. If memory is greater than 4 GBm 32 bit cannot handle. so higher memry ram is requried.

  _Price is decreasing and we are getting more performance._
